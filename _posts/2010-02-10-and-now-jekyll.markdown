title: And Now Jekyll
---

I've switched my blogging engine yet again. This time, hopefully, for keeps. I decided to go with the super simple, static site generator, Jekyll. I'm pretty happy with way it turned out. Even though it was pretty cool that the previous layout was generating it's own color scheme, this one is much cleaner in my opinion. 

I hope this new blog layout and 'coding like a hacker' will encourage me to write more posts.
